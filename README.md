# Project Title: Interactive Quiz and Test Generator

Description:

The "Interactive Quiz and Test Generator" is a comprehensive C++ project designed to facilitate the creation and management of educational quizzes and tests. It empowers teachers to efficiently compose, store, and generate randomized tests for their students. This project is a testament to my proficiency in C++, problem-solving skills, and ability to create user-friendly software.

Key Features:

Interactive Question Entry: The program provides a user-friendly interface for teachers to input questions, multiple-choice answers, and specify the correct answer. The questions are organized into a list for easy access.

Data Persistence: The application allows teachers to save the questions to a text file and load questions from an existing file. This ensures that valuable content is not lost and can be easily shared among educators.

Randomized Test Generation: A standout feature is the ability to generate randomized tests. Teachers can specify the number of questions they want in the test, and the program randomly selects questions from the list, eliminating the correct answers. This ensures each test is unique and minimizes the risk of cheating.

Complete Error Handling: The program features robust error handling to guide users and prevent incomplete or inconsistent data entry.

Technologies and Skills Demonstrated:

C++ Programming: The entire project is implemented in C++, showcasing my strong programming skills, adherence to best practices, and understanding of object-oriented principles.

File I/O: Effective data storage and retrieval from text files is achieved through file input/output operations.

Data Structures: I utilized data structures like classes and vectors to organize and manage questions.

Randomization: To generate unique tests, I employed the C++ standard library's randomization features.

User Interface Design: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, demonstrating my attention to user experience.

Impact and Future Development:

The "Interactive Quiz and Test Generator" is a valuable tool for educators to streamline the process of creating and administering tests. It enhances the educational experience by ensuring fair evaluation and reducing the burden of test creation. As a future development, I envision expanding this project to support a wider range of question types (e.g., true/false, open-ended) and integrating it with database systems for scalability
